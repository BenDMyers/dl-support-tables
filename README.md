# `<dl>` Support Tables

A lil [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) site built to provide an alternate way to visualize the cross-browser/screenreader `<dl>` support tables [Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com) put together in [his "brief" note from December 2022](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/12/brief-note-on-description-list-support.html). This site will periodically update to include any updates from Adrian's article.
